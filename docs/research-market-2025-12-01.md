## 2. Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

### Your Realistic Target: Self-Hosted + Developer/Design Teams

Applying filters to TAM:

| Filter | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Video conferencing market | $10-15B |
| × On-premise/self-hosted preference (57%) | $5.7-8.5B |
| × Small-to-mid enterprise segment (30%) | $1.7-2.5B |
| × Developer/design/IT teams specifically (~20%) | **$340-500M** |

**SAM Estimate: $340-500M annually** for self-hosted video conferencing targeting technical teams.

### Annotation/Visual Collaboration Niche

No specific market size data exists for "screen annotation in video calls" - this is an **underserved niche**. However:

- [Miro](https://miro.com/) (visual collaboration): 100M+ users, valued at $17.5B (2022)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (design collaboration): Acquired by Adobe for $20B (cancelled), now independent
- [Tuple](https://tuple.app/) (pair programming): $25-30/user/month premium pricing

The annotation feature could be your **differentiator** that justifies premium pricing in an otherwise commoditized market.

## 7. Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Type | Annotation? | Self-Hosted? | Pricing | Weaknesses |
|------------|------|-------------|--------------|---------|------------|
| **Zoom** | Proprietary SaaS | ✅ Yes (whiteboard) | ❌ No | $13-20/user/mo | Not self-hosted, data privacy concerns |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Proprietary SaaS | ✅ Yes (via Whiteboard) | ❌ No | $4-22/user/mo | Bundled with M365, heavy ecosystem |
| **Jitsi Meet** | Open Source | ❌ Limited | ✅ Yes | Free / JaaS pricing | No real-time annotations, quality issues |
| **BigBlueButton** | Open Source | ✅ Whiteboard only | ✅ Yes | Free | Education-focused, complex setup |
| **Element (Matrix)** | Open Source | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Custom | Chat-first, video secondary |

Sources: [Zoom Support - Annotations](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005706806-Using-annotation-tools-on-a-shared-screen-or-whiteboard), [Teams Annotation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-annotation-while-sharing-your-screen-in-microsoft-teams-876ba527-7112-437e-b410-5aec7363c473)

### Adjacent Competitors (Developer Tools)

| Tool | Focus | Pricing | Notes |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| **Tuple** | Pair programming | $25-30/user/mo | macOS/Windows only, premium positioning |
| **Pop** | Screen sharing | Free / $8/mo | Acquired by Figma, lightweight |
| **Around** | Video calls | Deprecated | Acquired, product sunset |
| **CoScreen** | Collaborative screens | Free | Acquired by Datadog |

**Key Insight:** The developer-focused collaboration space has seen **significant M&A activity** (Around, Pop, CoScreen all acquired). This validates demand but also indicates exit opportunity.

### Jitsi Limitations (Your Opportunity)

Based on user feedback and reviews ([Dyte - Jitsi](https://dyte.io/blog/jitsi-pricing/), [Capterra - Jitsi Reviews](https://www.capterra.com/p/162665/Jitsi/reviews/)):

| Issue | Impact | Etch Opportunity |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| **No screen annotations** | Cannot draw on shared content | Core differentiator |
| **Audio/video quality issues** | Sound lags, stability problems | Use LiveKit (battle-tested) |
| **Complex setup** | Hard for non-technical users | Docker one-liner deployment |
| **Limited enterprise features** | No SSO, admin controls out-of-box | Enterprise tier |
| **UI/UX polish** | Less intuitive than commercial | Developer-focused UX |
| **Scalability limits** | 200-250 comfortable, issues beyond | Target 2-10 users (sweet spot) |

> "Jitsi's video and audio quality are not robust, with multiple sound lags experienced during meetings" - [Dyte](https://dyte.io/blog/jitsi-pricing/)

### Zoom/Teams Annotation Comparison

Both Zoom and Teams **have** annotation features, but with limitations:

**Zoom Annotations:**
- ✅ Draw on shared screens (real-time)
- ✅ Whiteboard with persistence
- ✅ Spotlight/vanishing pen
- ❌ Cloud-only (no self-hosted)
- ❌ Data sovereignty concerns for enterprises

**Teams Annotations:**
- ✅ Powered by Microsoft Whiteboard
- ✅ Collaborative cursors
- ❌ Only works with full-screen share (not window share)
- ❌ Requires Microsoft ecosystem
- ❌ Not self-hosted

**Etch Differentiation:**
- ✅ Real-time annotation on ANY shared screen (<200ms latency)
- ✅ Fully self-hosted
- ✅ Open source (Apache 2.0)
- ✅ No ecosystem lock-in

### Open Source Screen Annotation Gap

**Critical Finding:** There is **no open-source video conferencing tool with integrated real-time screen annotations**.

Standalone annotation tools exist ([gInk](https://github.com/geovens/gInk), [Riter](https://www.trishtech.com/2024/10/riter-a-lightweight-open-source-screen-annotation-tool/), [ppInk](https://listoffreeware.com/free-open-source-screen-annotation-software-windows/)) but they:
- Don't sync across network
- Aren't integrated with video conferencing
- Are local-only tools

**This is your blue ocean.**

## 8. Risk Assessment

### Market Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Return-to-office mandates** | High | Medium | Focus on distributed-first teams (developers) who resist RTO |
| **Economic downturn** | Medium | Medium | Self-hosted = cost savings pitch; open-source = no vendor lock-in |
| **Market saturation** | Medium | Low | Annotation niche is underserved |
| **Big tech adds annotation features** | Medium | High | Move fast, build community moat |

> "Return-to-office mandates affected 67% of knowledge workers in 2024, up from 34% in 2023" - [JobsPikr](https://www.jobspikr.com/blog/remote-work-trends-2025/)

**Counter-argument:** Developer teams are among the **most resistant** to RTO mandates. Your target market is more remote-sticky than average.

### Competitive Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Zoom adds better annotations** | Medium | High | Open-source + self-hosted = different value prop |
| **Jitsi adds annotations** | Low | High | Community momentum, faster iteration |
| **New VC-funded competitor** | Medium | Medium | Open-source moat, community |
| **8x8 invests heavily in JaaS** | Medium | Medium | Self-hosted purists won't use JaaS |

### Execution Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Technical complexity (WebRTC)** | Medium | High | Use LiveKit (proven infrastructure) |
| **Slow community adoption** | Medium | High | Focus on GitHub stars, content marketing |
| **Enterprise sales cycle** | High | Medium | Start with prosumer/teams, graduate to enterprise |
| **Maintaining open-source while monetizing** | Medium | Medium | Clear open-core boundaries from day 1 |

### Opportunity Risks (Not Taking Action)

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Someone else builds it** | Lose first-mover advantage |
| **Annotation becomes table stakes** | Window closes |
| **Developer tools consolidation continues** | Acquisition targets dry up |

---

## 9. Strategic Recommendations

### Go-to-Market Strategy

**Phase 1: Community Building (Months 1-6)**
- Launch on GitHub with excellent README and documentation
- Target: 500 GitHub stars
- Create demo videos, blog posts, Hacker News launch
- Focus on "self-hosted Zoom alternative with annotations" positioning

**Phase 2: Prosumer Adoption (Months 6-12)**
- Introduce Pro tier ($12/user/mo)
- Build integrations (Slack notifications, calendar sync)
- Target: 100 paying teams, $50K ARR

**Phase 3: Enterprise Push (Year 2+)**
- Enterprise tier with SSO, air-gapped deployment
- Direct sales to security-conscious organizations
- Target: 20 enterprise customers, $200K+ ARR

### Positioning Statement

> **Etch** is the open-source meeting platform for teams who need to point at things. Unlike Zoom (cloud-only, privacy concerns) and Jitsi (no annotations), Etch lets you draw on shared screens in real-time while keeping all your data on your own servers.

### Core Strategy: Premium Feel, $0 Price

**"Make it a no-brainer to migrate."**

| Competitor | Experience | Price | Etch Strategy |
|------------|------------|-------|-------------------|
| Tuple | Premium (5K, low latency) | $30/user/mo | Match quality, $0 |
| Zoom | Good enough | $13-20/user/mo | Better annotations, $0 |
| Jitsi | Mediocre (quality issues) | $0 | Premium quality, $0 |

**How to achieve premium at $0:**
- High bitrate streaming (VP9, 4-6 Mbps) = text is crisp
- Sub-200ms annotation latency = feels instant
- One-click deployment = easier than Jitsi
- Developer-focused UX = no enterprise bloat
- Self-hosted = no ongoing costs for users

**This is how open source wins:** Give away what others charge $30/user for.

### Key Differentiators to Emphasize

1. **"The pointing finger moment"** - Draw on what you see, everyone sees it instantly
2. **Self-hosted = your data** - GDPR compliance, data sovereignty
3. **Open source = no lock-in** - Apache 2.0, inspect/modify/embed
4. **Developer-first** - Code review, pair programming, technical collaboration

## 10. Answering Your Question: "How Greedy Can I Be?"

### The Honest Answer

| Greed Level | Revenue | Probability | What It Takes |
|-------------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Modest** | $100-500K ARR | High (70%) | Good product, some marketing |
| **Comfortable** | $1-5M ARR | Medium (40%) | Strong community, enterprise sales |
| **Ambitious** | $10-30M ARR | Low-Medium (20%) | Mattermost-level execution |
| **Exit Play** | $50-200M acquisition | Low (10%) | Right timing, right buyer |

### Comparables for Exit Valuation

| Company | Revenue at Exit | Exit Value | Multiple |
|---------|-----------------|------------|----------|
| **HashiCorp** | ~$600M ARR | $6.4B | ~10x |
| **Mattermost** (projected) | $33M ARR | Est. $200-400M | 6-12x |
| **CoScreen** (Datadog) | Unknown | Unknown | Strategic |
| **Around** (Miro) | Unknown | Unknown | Strategic |

**Realistic Exit Scenario for Etch:**
- At $5M ARR with 50% growth: **$30-60M acquisition value** (6-12x multiple)
- At $10M ARR: **$60-120M**
- Strategic premium possible if annotation tech is valuable (SDK licensing, embedding)

### The "Greedy" Path

If you want to maximize value:

1. **Build in public** - GitHub stars = social proof = higher valuation
2. **Enterprise customers early** - Revenue quality matters more than quantity
3. **Keep annotation tech modular** - The SDK could be worth more than the app
4. **Time the market** - Developer tools consolidation is happening NOW (CoScreen, Around, Pop all acquired 2022-2024)

### The "Sustainable" Path

If you want ongoing income:

1. **Focus on $12-20/user/mo recurring** - Sustainable without VC
2. **Keep team small** - Mattermost does $33M with 156 people; you could do $1M solo
3. **Self-hosted = low infrastructure costs** - Customers run their own servers
4. **Open source community = free R&D** - Contributors build features for you
